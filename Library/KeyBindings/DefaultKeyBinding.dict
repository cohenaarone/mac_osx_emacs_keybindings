 * Additional keybindings for emacs emulation

 *
 * WARNING:
 *
 * This file uses the Option key as a meta key.  This overrides the Mac OS keybindings for the option key, which produce common symbols and non-English letters.
 * To access the original binding of an Option combination, simply type Control-Q and the binding, and the original character will be output.
 * If that doesn't work on your platform, run this and you should be g2g:
 *
 * defaults write -g NSQuotedKeystrokeBinding -string "^q"
 *
 * NOTES:
 *
 * We use cut:, copy:, paste: for C-w, M-w, C-y rather than deleteToMark:, selectToMark:, yank: for 2 reasons:
 *
 * 1. It permits copy/paste or cut/paste across applications
 *
 * 2. It permits an implementation of M-w that actually works consistently and correctly
 *
 * To see in xml syntax which keybindings Mac OSX has already defined for you, run the following at a terminal prompt and then open ~/mac_key_bindings.dict -
 *
 * plutil -convert xml1 /System/Library/Frameworks/AppKit.framework/Versions/C/Resources/StandardKeyBinding.dict -o ~/mac_key_bindings.dict
 *
 * We deliberately do *not* repeat herein any keybindings already defined by the OS *unless* we override them.
 *
 * To set up C-u to be the repeat count keybinding, run the following at a terminal prompt.
 * Be aware that if you do this *any* use of C-u (even within a sequence of keys) will eval to the repeat count method.
 *
 * defaults write -g NSRepeatCountBinding -string "^u"
 *
 * Finally, I would *love* to find a way around Macs not allowing the rebinding M-n, M-u, and M-e - I can't help but hope that there's some way of hacking whatever it is that prevents their rebinding.
 * If anybody has any clues, please let me know ...
